In summary, we proposed the SIDIS measurement on various light nuclei targets (D and $^4$He) by tagging the backward recoiling spectator. By taking the advantage of the high luminosity and large kinematic coverage of CLAS12, we will be able to cover a wide range in $x$. We propose a new low momentum recoil detector to fit our experimental needs in term of slow nuclei detection. The detector is designed such that it will provide good timing resolution and particle identification. The measured semi-inclusive EMC ratio and its dependence on the recoil kinematics are expected to provide new insight into the origins of the EMC effect.

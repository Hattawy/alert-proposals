{\large\textbf{Abstract:}}

We propose to measure semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering from light nuclei ($^2$H and $^4$He). The detection of the low energy recoil (p, $^3$H and $^3$He), in addition to the scattered electron, will provide unique information about the nature of the EMC effect and its dependence on the bound nucleon virtuality. In particular, the proposed experiment will provide stringent tests leading to clear differentiation between the many models describing the EMC effect.

The proposed measurements will use the 11~GeV electron beam on thin gaseous targets and the upgraded CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS12) with a new recoil detector. The latter will be installed inside the solenoid magnet instead of the CLAS12 Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT). The scattered electrons will be detected in CLAS12, while the fragments of the nuclear target will be detected in the recoil detector. 
This detector will be composed of a stereo drift chamber for track reconstruction and an array 
of scintillators for particle identification. Coupling these two types of fast detectors will 
ensure that it can be included in the trigger to reject background efficiently, while keeping 
the quantity of material as low as possible to detect low energy particles.

The experiment requires a total of xxx days of running time, assuming a maximum of xxx~nA beam current. We will need xx days at 11 GeV for the measurements on $^4$He, xx days at 11 GeV for the measurements on deuterium and 7 days at various energies for commissioning and calibration runs using hydrogen and helium targets. In the ALERT run group, the beam time for calibration and with helium target (xxx days) can be shared with the proposed helium DVCS experiments and the totality of the beam time will be shared with the tagged DVCS proposal.
